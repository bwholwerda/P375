    "There are some problems in science that are so complicated that they just can’t be analyzed by formulas that you can write down on a piece of paper. This is particularly true in biology and health sciences because the problems are so complex. One example is the folding and shape of proteins.  This is famously a very difficult problem. How do you solve such problems? Well, one technique is to use probability, random numbers, and computation. These methods are known as Monte Carlo methods.  They are named after the town of Monte Carlo in the country of Monaco, which is a tiny little country on the coast of France which is famous for its casinos, hence the name. These methods rely on computers to simulate the results and these were first really used in the Manhattan project in a serious way. Now, however, they are used in all fields: understand systems like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding systems: cost overruns or time overruns.\n",
    "Finance: predicting if a commodity price is going to go up or down.\n",
    "Resource exploration: oil and other minerals\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these different fields use Monte Carlo methods to gain a deeper understanding of complex problems."
