PHYS 375 Advanced Scientific Computing

This intermediate level data analysis and manipulation class develops skills in programming with high-level programming languages such as Python, Matlab, and Mathematica to create software programs and use libraries for physics-based modeling and the analysis of data from natural phenomena.  The course focuses on how to clean and prepare data for discovery of correlations and systematic behavior, the implementation of relevant models, linear and multi-parameter regression, error propagation and mitigation,  and model fit evaluation. 

Course Contents:

Programming fundamentals for any language

Programming  Python online and on your own computer.

Using Python tools and libraries: Jupyter notebooks, numpy, scipy, and scikit among others.

Graphing and visualizing data with Python: matplotlib, plotly among others.

Programming online with  comprehensive computing environments such Mathematica or Matlab and use of their libraries, functional approach, and symbolic tools. 

Reading, creating, and writing databases of various types.

Cleaning  and preparing data for analysis, fitting with several coupled  parameters to data, evaluating model fits and estimating errors, and applying statistical tests against hypotheses. 

Identifying and estimating systematic and random error, and mitigating errors in fitting and in experiments or data collection.

Fourier Transforms in space and time

Application of Bayesian statistics to use, visualize,  and interpret Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of data and models.
